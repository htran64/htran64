Hello, my name is . Growing up, I spent countless hours tinkering with my computer and playing games, but I never really cared about what was happening behind the scenes—at least not at first. It was all about the experience and fun for me. However, as I got older, I started to develop more curiosity about how things worked, especially when it came to technology. On the flip side, I’ve always had a passion for travel, which sparked my deep interest in aviation. There’s something incredible about the way planes work, and I’ve always been fascinated by the combination of engineering and exploration.


  Before college, I found myself at a crossroads, trying to decide between attending aviation school, possibly through the Air Force, or pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. After weighing my options, I ultimately chose the bachelor's degree because it felt like a safer and more flexible choice for the long run. That’s not to say my love for aviation and traveling has disappeared, in fact, it's still very much alive. There’s a part of me that’s still considering going back to explore that path more deeply, and maybe combining my tech skills with my passion for flight one day.
